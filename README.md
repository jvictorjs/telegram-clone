## About Telegram

Telegram is one of the most used messaging apps in the World. https://www.statista.com/statistics/258749/most-popular-global-mobile-messenger-apps/

As of September 2022, it has surpassed 700 milion users.
It is open source and has really good API documetation.
> "Telegram has public APIs with which developers can access the same functionality as Telegram's official apps to build their own messaging applications.
...
Telegram also offers an API that allows developers to create bots, which are accounts controlled by programs. Such bots are used, among other things, to emulate and play old games in the app and inform users about vaccine availability for COVID-19.
In addition, Telegram offers functions for making payments directly within the platform, alongside an external service such as Stripe."
